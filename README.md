The Gathering
=============


We’re once again organising [RubyConf Portugal][rubyconfpt], a conference for rubyists and web enthusiasts in general. In order to welcome everyone and gather the local community for the main event, we decided to host a small [*unconference*][unconference]-like event that ends with a glorious Welcoming Party for this year’s RubyConf Portugal.

We’ll gather in marvellous old buildings, that once served as the city’s police headquarters and was recently renovated to serve as the city’s entrepreneurial nest, and talk about all things concerning Web and technology in general.


## Submit a session

We encourage everyone to submit a session. It can be a talk, a small chat group, an interest in something cool. If you have people interested in attending it we’ll get it on the agenda.

Sessions will be grouped by the following types:

* **Long presentations**: the typical long, more formal presentation format (+10min);
* **Short presentations to get things started**: not so short as a lightning talk, around 5-10min;
* **Group discussions**: bring a theme to the table and let the voices of the crowd be heard;
* **My Big (or Little) Question**: challenge our assumptions;
* **Show and Tell**: it's ok to brag a ~~little~~ lot;
* **Learn how to do X**: we must all strive to learn something new, everyday.

NOTE: the durations referred here are merely examples.

To submit your session simply fork this repository and add a file containing a description of your session under the corresponding type's directory. Use the format `<author>-<title>`, where both `author` and `title` must be written in `snake_case` (we're ruby people after all). Feel free to use any [markup supported by GitHub][github-markup].

After that, you'll only have to create a pull request back to this repository. Attendees will then be able to comment on their favourites and make suggestions. Similar sessions may even get merged together, but only if their authors decide to.


## Partake

Even if you choose not to marvel us with a session of your own, everyone is invited to [join us][the-gathering] for some hours of learning, teaching or just hanging out.

Ending the event we’ll meet the attendees and coaches of Rails Girls Braga and kick-off the conference.

If you’re around the evening before the conference, stop by for a nice chat, duly followed by some drinks and snacks. It’s all on us! :smile:
